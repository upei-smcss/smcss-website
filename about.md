<h1 align="centre">About US</h1>
<p>The School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences Society (SMCSS) is a student club ratified under the University of Prince Edward Island's Student Union. 
Our objectives are:</p>
<ul>
<li>To provide an environment of mutual support so that students of the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences may know each other better,</li>
<li>To provide community outreach through appropriate activities that engage other UPEI students, and upper-level secondary school students which will make the fields of Mathematics and Computer Science better known,</li>
<li>To promote a relationship of friendship and respectful collegiality with staff and faculty of the School of Mathematical and Computational Sciences, as well as those of related Departments or Faculties whom joint events may be scheduled, and</li>
<li>To provide an experience consistent with those found at Universities and Colleges worldwide where such departmentally-oriented student societies are also common.</li></ul>
