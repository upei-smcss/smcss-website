Convenient storage at the heart of campus!</h1>

<p align="center">Would you like to have a locker in the center of campus? The SMCSS sells lockers on the bottom floor of the Cass Science Hall for just $10 a semester plus a $10 deposit which will be refunded at the end of the semester if you follow the rules below.</p>

<p>Locker Rules:<br>
<UL>
<LI>No food in the lockers for an extended period of time, leaving food too long can result in mold, bad smells, and unwanted bugs<br>
<LI>Lockers must be cleaned out and locks removed by the last day of classes in a semester, failure to do so will result in your $10 deposit not being refunded
</UL>
</p>
<p align="centre">How can you get your hands on a locker? Contact any one of the executive members of the society through Facebook or email.<br>
The $20 fee for your locker can be paid in cash to any executive member or e-transferred to smcss@upeisu.ca</p>
